# About

A simple Python GUI application using PyQt5 to get some weather info in a specified city using [OpenWeather - Current Weather Data API](https://openweathermap.org/). 

Info Given:
- Temperature (Kelvin, Celsius or Fahrenheit)
- Relative Humidity (Percentage)
- Description of weather condition with associated icon
- Time data is taken (UTC time)

## How to Use

Ensure that you are connected to the Internet. After that, you only need to type in the name of the city (not case-sensitive) and click the "Get Weather" button. The weather info will then be displayed. 

If you wish to get the temperature in a different unit, you can switch the temperature unit by using the given buttons and pressing "Get Weather" again.

## Upcoming Features

There are many more weather info about the city that can be added, such as wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, etc...

I just felt that the 4 info given were the most important for now. I should probably think of a way to fit all the extra info in the GUI in the future (hopefully).
